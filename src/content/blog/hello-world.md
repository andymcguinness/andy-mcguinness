If you're reading this, you've stumbled upon the freshly redesigned version of my website! Whether you're a longtime visitor or a first-time guest, welcome!

## Out with the Old, In with the Astro

I've completely rebuilt the site in Astro with support for a Markdown blog. Why? Well, Astro has been on my radar for a while, and a personal blog felt like the perfect playground to take it for a spin. It's been fun to build with, and I'm really enjoying how it turned out! 

## What's This Blog All About?

The blog portion of my website is going to be a mix of things I'm learning, building, and exploring. You'll see:

- **Tips and tricks**: I'll share the shortcuts, workarounds, and discoveries that have saved me time (or headaches).
- **Project write-ups**: You'll get breakdowns of projects I'm working on, what went well, what didn't, and what I learned along the way.
- **My 12 Certifications in 12 Months quest**: This is the big one, and honestly, it deserves its own section...

## The Quest: 12 Certifications in 12 Months

I'm embarking on what might be an overly ambitious (or perfectly ambitious, depending on who you ask) challenge to earn 12 certifications in 12 months. Yep, you read that right. One certification per month, give or take, for an entire year.

Why would I do this to myself? Great question.

I've spent my career as something of a jack of all trades. I've worked across different languages, frameworks, platforms, and problem domains. It's been fantastic, as I love the variety and the ability to jump into whatever a project needs! But there's a flip side to being a generalist: sometimes you feel like you know a little about a lot, but not enough about anything.

This quest is my way of changing that: I want to take the skills I've dabbled in and really _solidify_ them. I want to prove to myself (and, frankly, to potential collaborators and employers) that I'm not just passingly familiar with these technologies, but that I can dive deep, understand the nuances, and come out the other side certified.

The certifications I'm tackling span a pretty wide range: Java, Python, Apache Spark, Databricks, and more. These aren't random picks -- they're all technologies I've worked with or want to work with more seriously. Each one is a chance to level up and fill in gaps in my knowledge.

**First up?** Java SE 21. I'm kicking things off with the Java certification because, well, you've got to start somewhere, and Java has been something I've wanted to become more proficient in for some time. 

## Why You Should Stick Around

If you're into tech, learning, or just watching someone take on a potentially ridiculous challenge, this blog is for you. I'll be documenting the whole journey: what I'm studying, what resources I'm using, what's working, and what's making me want to throw my laptop out a window (kidding... mostly).

But here's the thing: this isn't just about me. If you're considering getting certified yourself, or you're trying to level up in any of these areas, I want this to be a resource for you too. I'll share study materials, practice exams, tips for staying motivated, and anything else that might help you on your own learning journey.

And if you've been down this road before? I'd love to hear from you. Seriously. Drop me a line, share your advice, tell me what worked for you. Learning is always better when it's a conversation.
